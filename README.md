# photobloc

Hello! Thanks for taking a look.
My name is Caio Zubek, and this is Photobloc.
This is a simple, but functional Flutter app built following the great Vandad Nahavandipoor's BLoC course.
It consists of a "Photo Gallery" app, which allows you to register, upload and delete images. It uses Google's Firebase for authentication and storage.
Building this app was a very productive learning exercise, it helped me to grasp the core concepts of BLoC state management & implement them in a real world scenario. Hopefully it can also serve as a bit of reference to you as well. 
Once more, thanks for passing by. I'd love to hear some feedback and ideas for this and other projects.
Have a good one!
